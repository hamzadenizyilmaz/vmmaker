## üèó Architecture

The architecture of VM Maker is a distributed, multi-tiered system designed to handle high volumes of device data, ensure fault tolerance, and provide a scalable foundation for global operations. The system is segmented into distinct layers, each optimized for specific functions, and includes redundancy to mitigate single points of failure.

- **Frontend Layer**: The frontend is powered by a modern JavaScript framework, hosted on a Plesk-managed web server. The administrative dashboard (`dash.vmmaker.com`) and customer-facing interfaces are rendered using server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. This layer communicates with the backend API layer via secure HTTPS connections, leveraging load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple frontend instances.

- **Backend Layer**: Built on a Node.js/Express stack running on Ubuntu servers, the backend handles API requests, business logic, and data processing. The backend is deployed across multiple regional data centers (e.g., Turkey, France, USA, Germany) to reduce latency and improve availability. Each regional backend instance includes a primary server cluster and a secondary failover cluster, synchronized via a distributed database system. The backend API communicates bidirectionally with the dashboard, sending real-time updates and receiving configuration commands.

- **Database Layer**: A MySQL-based relational database management system serves as the data repository, storing user accounts, device configurations, sensor data, and billing information. The database is replicated across primary and backup instances within each region, with cross-regional synchronization for disaster recovery. The architecture employs a master-slave replication model, where the master handles write operations and slaves manage read requests, ensuring high availability and load distribution.

- **Integration Layer**: This layer facilitates communication with third-party services (e.g., Discord, SMTP, Stripe) using dedicated microservices. Each microservice is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, allowing for independent scaling and updates. The integration layer interfaces with the backend API to process incoming requests and forward responses to the dashboard or external systems.

- **Device Communication Layer**: ESP32 devices connect to the platform via regional APIs using MQTT, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols. This layer includes edge gateways that preprocess data before transmission to the backend, reducing bandwidth usage and improving response times. The layer also supports over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates, managed through the administrative dashboard.

The architecture is designed with a microservices-based approach, ensuring modularity and resilience. Regional servers are interconnected via a private virtual network, with traffic routed through a content delivery network (CDN) to optimize global performance.
