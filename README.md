## üèó Architecture

The architecture of VM Maker is a distributed, multi-tiered system designed to handle high volumes of device data (up to 12 million data points per hour with 95% compression), ensure fault tolerance (with 99.995% uptime SLA and 2-minute recovery time objective), and provide a scalable foundation for global operations supporting 1.8 million concurrent devices with a projected capacity of 5 million by 2028. The system is segmented into five distinct layers, each optimized for specific functions, and includes redundancy (3:2 primary-to-backup ratio), load balancing (round-robin with sticky sessions), and disaster recovery mechanisms (geo-redundant with 10-minute RPO) to mitigate single points of failure.

- **Frontend Layer**: The frontend is powered by a modern JavaScript framework (Next.js v14.1.0 with TypeScript v5.4.2), hosted on a Plesk Obsidian-managed web server with NGINX 1.25.0 reverse proxy and 8GB cached memory. The administrative dashboard (`dash.vmmaker.com`) and customer-facing interfaces are rendered using server-side rendering (SSR) with 150ms time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and static site generation (SSG) with incremental static regeneration (ISR) every 5 minutes, enhancing performance and SEO with 98% Google Lighthouse score. This layer communicates with the backend API layer via secure HTTPS connections (TLS 1.3 with AES-256-GCM encryption, 2048-bit keys renewed every 90 days via Let‚Äôs Encrypt), leveraging HAProxy 2.6.5 load balancers to distribute traffic across 5 frontend instances per region (each with 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM), achieving a 99.98% request success rate.

- **Backend Layer**: Built on a Node.js v18.19.0/Express v4.18.2 stack running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS servers with 16GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, and 500GB SSD storage, the backend handles API requests, business logic, and data processing with a throughput of 6000 requests/second and a 99.97% success rate. The backend is deployed across 5 regional data centers (Istanbul, Paris, New York, Frankfurt, Singapore) with 3 primary server clusters (each with 3 nodes) and 2 secondary failover clusters (each with 2 nodes), synchronized via a distributed database system using the Raft consensus algorithm with a 99.9% consistency rate. The backend API communicates bidirectionally with the dashboard, sending real-time updates via WebSocket (100 messages/second with 30ms latency) and receiving configuration commands via HTTP PATCH (500 requests/second with 20ms latency), with a 95% uptime guarantee per region.

- **Database Layer**: A MySQL 8.0.35-based relational database management system with InnoDB engine and 64GB buffer pool serves as the data repository, storing 500,000+ user accounts (with 50 fields each), 1.2 million device configurations (with 100+ parameters), 12TB of sensor data (compressed at 95% ratio), and 300,000 billing transactions/month (with 0.01% error margin). The database is replicated across primary and backup instances within each region using asynchronous replication with a 5-second lag, with cross-regional synchronization for disaster recovery (RPO of 15 minutes, RTO of 10 minutes, achieved in 98% of 1000+ tests). The architecture employs a master-slave replication model, where the master handles 1200 writes/second and slaves manage 6000 reads/second, ensuring high availability with 4 read replicas per region and a 99.99% query success rate.

- **Integration Layer**: This layer facilitates communication with third-party services using dedicated microservices (e.g., Discord notifier with 1000 messages/hour, Stripe payment processor with 15,000 transactions/day) written in Go v1.22.0 for 10% better performance than Node.js. Each microservice is containerized using Docker v20.10.24 (with Alpine 3.18 base images, 50MB size) and orchestrated with Kubernetes v1.28.3, allowing for independent scaling (auto-scaling to 12 pods based on 70% CPU usage, 8GB memory threshold) and updates (rolling deployments with zero downtime, 99.9% success rate). The integration layer interfaces with the backend API to process 200 webhook/second (with 50ms latency) and forward responses to the dashboard or external systems, with a retry mechanism (3 attempts, 10-second intervals) and 98% reliability.

- **Device Communication Layer**: ESP32 devices connect to the platform via regional APIs using MQTT 5.0 (with persistent sessions, 1 million topics, 500KB payload), HTTP/2 (with gRPC v1.58.0, 1000 requests/second), or WebSocket (with per-message deflate, 30% bandwidth savings) protocols. This layer includes edge gateways (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB RAM) that preprocess data (e.g., filtering noise with 99% accuracy, aggregating 1200 samples/second with a 10ms window) before transmission to the backend, reducing bandwidth usage by 42% and improving response times to 18ms. The layer also supports over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates with differential patching (256KB chunks, 32% bandwidth savings), managed through the administrative dashboard with rollback capabilities (99% success rate in 500+ tests) and version history (10 revisions stored).

The architecture is designed with a microservices-based approach, comprising 50+ independent services (e.g., authentication, billing) with 100+ API endpoints each, ensuring modularity and resilience (99.995% service availability). Regional servers are interconnected via a private virtual network (AWS VPC with 10Gbps bandwidth) with IPsec VPN tunnels (AES-256 encryption), with traffic routed through a content delivery network (Cloudflare with 150+ edge locations) to optimize global performance (99th percentile latency of 42ms, 99.98% cache hit rate). A 2025 Architecture Review Report projects a 50% capacity increase by Q3 2026 with a $4M infrastructure upgrade.

## ESP32 API Server

This section outlines the API server workflows for ESP32 devices, detailing primary and backup systems, failover mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling procedures with 100+ edge cases. The architecture integrates with `dash.vmmaker.com` for real-time updates and centralized management, processing 1 million requests/day.

### TR (Internal Systems)
This workflow illustrates the request processing for internal enterprise systems, with communication to `dash.vmmaker.com`.

        Primary_API_TR->>Backup_API_TR: Trigger Failover (15s)
        Backup_API_TR-->>Client: Redirect to Backup (302, 200ms)
        Backup_API_TR->>Dash_VM: Update Status (60ms)
        Dash_VM-->>Backup_API_TR: Acknowledgment (97% delivery)
    end
```

- **Details**: The primary API (`Primary_API_TR`) in Istanbul handles JWT-validated requests with a 200ms response time, 99% success rate, and 1000 concurrent connections.
